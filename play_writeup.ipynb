    "# Deciphering and Analysis of Shakespeare play\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I am tasked with deciphering a given Shakespeare text, I begin with cleaning the translated text data by taking care of unwanted characters and formatting. After this, I create visualisations that highlight key features of the text, such as word length, words per line and most frequent words. It is useful to note that due to it being for a first year module, the only libraries I was permitted to use were `matplotlib` and `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "The shift of the cipher was determined by the greatest common divisor of the `user_number` which was pre-set to be 506 and the value $k$ such that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sum_{n=1}^{k}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[5]{n}} > 506 \\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this I first wrote a function containing the sum above, then used the result within the `find_shift` function to find the value of $k$. In the same function I also wrote Euclid's algorithm to compute the GCD of the value of $k$ and `user_number` which is the shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualisation and Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I created visualisations of the top 20 words, the distribution of word length and the words per line. I chose three different type of graphs, namely, a bar chart, histogram, and scatter diagram to convey each bit of data differently. Along with the visualisations I also display some information on the most common word, word length etc. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I first started by analysing the top 20 words over 3 characters long throughout the entire play script.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/top_20_words_bar.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "  <div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: gray; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">\n",
    "    Figure 1: Top 20 words over 3 characters\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "From this plot, we can see that the most common word over 3 characters is \"that\". <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I created a histogram to show the distribution of the word length throughout the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/word_length_distn_hist.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "  <div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: gray; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">\n",
    "    Figure 2: Distribution of word length\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that this roughly resembles a Normal distribution (bell-curve), and we can read off from the histogram that the most common word length is between 6 and 7 characters long. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The final plot was looking at the words per line. I chose to do a scatter plot because it clearly shows the variation in line lengths throughout the play. Each point represents a single line in the play.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/words_per_line_scatter.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "  <div style=\"font-size: 14px; color: gray; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;\">\n",
    "    Figure 3: Words per each line in the play\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can read from the scatter plot to see that largest amount of words per one line was just under 400, that's a big speech!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involved deciphering, cleaning and analysing a scrambled Shakespeare text to find patterns in word usage and line structure. Visualisations like bar and scatter plots as well as histograms helped highlight features of the text. Overall, this project highlights skills in Python, text analysis and visualisation through the use of `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements for the future: \n",
    "- character speeches \n",
    "- words per speech along with plot of character name against speech length\n",
    "- dialogue in scenes with plot of scenes against number of lines in scene\n",
    "\n",
