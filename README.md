# Deciphering and Analysing Shakespeare Play

In this project, completed as part of a first year university module, I worked with a scrambled version of a Shakespeare play. I deciphered the text, extracted structured data, and created visualisations based on it. Full details on the project and how the play was scrambled can be found [here](play_writeup.ipynb).
